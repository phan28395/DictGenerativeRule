# Popup Dictionary Data Requirements Guide

## Overview
Each glance level define a level of interest of user of the popup-dictionary-App. First glance is what User see when the popup is triggered, second-glance is when he click on a definition, third-glance is.
First glance will be a list of the POS and the available definition for each of them. Arrange according to the frequency of the POS of that word and rank of usage of the definition within that POS. If the word have only one POS and one definition then second glance could be directly show.
This guide details the exact data needed for each word type across three glance levels in a popup dictionary app.

## Etymology/Origin Data Requirements

### When to Include Etymology (Only ~5% of Words):
1. **Explains contradictions** (cleave = split AND stick together)
2. **Clarifies spelling** (island has silent 's' from false etymology)
3. **Illuminates word families** (fact/factory/manufacture from "make")
4. **Tells engaging story** (salary from Roman salt money)
5. **Explains idioms** (worth your salt)

### Etymology Data Structure:
```
etymology: {
  include: true,  // boolean decision
  micro_story: "expire: ex- (out) + spirare (breathe) = breathe your last",
  full_story: "Originally meant 'breathe one's last breath' (1400s)...",
  visual_timeline: [
    {period: "1400s", meaning: "die", literal: "breathe out last breath"},
    {period: "1700s", meaning: "end", expansion: "licenses, documents"},
    {period: "1990s", meaning: "digital", expansion: "software, subscriptions"}
  ],
  related_words: ["inspire", "respiratory", "spirit"],
  insight: "All these words share the idea of breath/life"
}
```

### Etymology Preparation Notes:
- **Skip boring Latin/Greek** unless it adds understanding
- **Focus on story**, not linguistic technicalities
- **Modern relevance first** - work backwards from current usage
- **Visual when possible** - timelines, word trees
- **Keep it under 50 words** for micro version
- **Test the "Aha!" factor** - does it create understanding?
